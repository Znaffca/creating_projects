# SAMPLE SCRIPT TO AUTOMATE CREATING PROJECTS IN PYTHON

### How it suposed to work - what does that script should do:

- create project folder in specified directory 
- add a few basic files like .gitignore, requirements, README
- create a virtualenv with the name convention `{project_name}_env`
- init git repository and add all created files to git
- create remote repository with name like local project
- add local repo to remote and push project to github
- run Visual Studio Code with rcently created project

### Changes in the future

- remove created repository (local and remote) and virtualenv with one command,
- check if project name contains invalid chars
- auto create environment variables and add them to shell configuration
- code reformat
